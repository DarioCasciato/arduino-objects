# Arduino Objects

This repository contains libraries or classes for the Arduino platform. Each library provides an object-oriented approach to working with different components or functionalities in Arduino projects.


## Usage

Once you have installed the desired library, you can use the provided objects and functions in your Arduino projects. Here's a general outline of how to use a library:

1. Include the library in your Arduino sketch using the `#include` directive. The library name should match the name of the library folder.
2. Create an instance of the library object using the appropriate constructor.
3. Use the library object's methods and properties to interact with the component or functionality it provides.
4. Upload your Arduino sketch to the board and observe the desired behavior based on the library's functionality.

Please refer to the specific library's documentation or examples for more detailed usage instructions and code samples.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional libraries or classes to add for different Arduino components or functionalities, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b new-library`.
3. Implement your library or class.
4. Add documentation and examples to showcase the usage of the library.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin new-library`.
6. Open a pull request to the main repository, describing your changes and the purpose of your contribution.
